# Print Settings

You'll find printable STLs in the 3D_print_file section. The majority of the parts were printed with the following settings:

| |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Material:** | PLA |
| **Layer Height:**| 0.2 mm|
| **Infill:**| 15% Gyroid|
| **Supports:**| Support enforcer only used in the main Lou body, and only for the area that holds the servo|


The majority of the parts were printed at the same time and should take just over 4 hours to print. 

The stop sign was printed in silver and red, with a colour change to really make the text pop.

I'll be adding a .3mf file to make things easier!

[2020-07-23]: Added a new version of Lou, with a gap in the back to help with wire routing.
